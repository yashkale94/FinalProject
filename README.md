# FinalProject

## Introduction
This project aims at analysing the performances of the football clubs in the English Premier League for the 2018-19 season. I aim to see how different clubs perform in different stages of the season, how many cards they earn, how they fare against their fellow neighbours. In particular, I will focus on top 6 clubs and see how they fare amongst the other top 6 clubs. This analysis should provide a good insight to football fans around the world on how their club is performing.
