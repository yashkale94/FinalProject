# FinalProject

## Introduction
This project aims at analysing the performances of the football clubs in the English Premier League for the 2018-19 season. I aim to see how different clubs perform in different stages of the season, how many cards they earn, how they fare against their fellow neighbours. In particular, I will focus on top 6 clubs and see how they fare amongst the other top 6 clubs. This analysis should provide a good insight to football fans around the world on how their club is performing.

## STUDY
For the various questions mentioned in the Jupyter notebook, I used the csv file provided in this repo. The analysis is focused on the the top6 clubs in the league and 1-2 questions about the league in general. I have tried to analyse how the top6 clubs match up against each other, when compared to the lower ranked teams in England. The three plots that are embedded in this repo are generated to show how the performances of clubs changed in the league through out the season. I also filtered on the dates column in the csv, to see the performance of clubs in the famous 'festive season' of the Premier League, which is notorious to cause injuries to players of different clubs.
